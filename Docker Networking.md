# Docker Networking

Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. By default, Docker provides several network modes to support different use cases. Understanding Docker networking is essential for ensuring proper communication between containers, services, and the host machine.

Docker provides different networking options, such as **bridge**, **host**, **overlay**, **none**, and custom networks. These networks determine how containers communicate with each other, the host system, and external networks.

### Types of Docker Networks

1. **Bridge Network (Default)**

   - **Purpose**: The **bridge network** is the default network mode for containers when no network is specified.
   - **How it works**: When a container is connected to the bridge network, Docker creates a virtual bridge (usually `docker0` on the host), and containers are assigned unique IP addresses on that bridge. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using their IP addresses, but they cannot access the host network directly.
   - **Use case**: This mode is typically used for containers running on a single host where you don’t need to expose ports to the host machine.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name container1 --network bridge nginx
   docker run -d --name container2 --network bridge nginx
   ```

2. **Host Network**

   - **Purpose**: In **host network mode**, containers share the host's network namespace, which means they can access the host's network interfaces directly.
   - **How it works**: A container running in host network mode does not get its own IP address but shares the host's IP address. The container uses the same network interfaces as the host machine, so it can communicate directly with the outside world.
   - **Use case**: This mode is useful when you want the container to have direct access to the host’s network (for example, for performance-critical applications).
   
   **Example**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name container1 --network host nginx
   ```

   **Note**: Host networking is not available on Windows containers.

3. **Overlay Network**

   - **Purpose**: **Overlay networks** are used to enable communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts. This is commonly used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for multi-host container orchestration.
   - **How it works**: Overlay networks create a virtual network that spans multiple hosts, allowing containers to communicate as if they were on the same physical network. Docker uses VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) to create the virtual network.
   - **Use case**: This mode is used in orchestration environments, such as Docker Swarm, where containers need to communicate across different machines.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   docker network create -d overlay my_overlay_network
   ```

4. **None Network**

   - **Purpose**: The **none network mode** is used when you don’t want a container to have any network connectivity at all.
   - **How it works**: Containers connected to the `none` network are completely isolated from the network. This can be useful when you need a container with no network access (for example, in a security-sensitive application).
   - **Use case**: Used for highly isolated containers where network communication is not necessary.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name container1 --network none nginx
   ```

5. **Custom Networks (User-defined Networks)**

   - **Purpose**: **Custom networks** allow you to define specific network settings, such as subnet and gateway, and provide better isolation and communication between containers.
   - **How it works**: When you create a custom network, Docker automatically creates a DNS-based service discovery system for containers, so they can refer to each other by container name (instead of IP address). Docker also allows more fine-grained control over IP addresses and subnets.
   - **Use case**: Custom networks are ideal for scenarios where you need to configure network settings for specific containers or groups of containers. This is typically used in microservices and multi-container applications.

   **Example**:
   1. Create a custom bridge network:
      ```bash
      docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
      ```

   2. Run containers on the custom network:
      ```bash
      docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network nginx
      docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network nginx
      ```

### Docker Network Drivers

Docker supports several **network drivers** that define how networking is handled in Docker containers. The most commonly used drivers are:

1. **bridge**: Default driver, used for single-host communication between containers.
2. **host**: Used when containers share the host’s network stack.
3. **overlay**: Used for multi-host networking, typically in Swarm or Kubernetes.
4. **macvlan**: Allows containers to have their own MAC address and appear as physical devices on the network.
5. **none**: No networking at all.
6. **custom drivers**: Docker allows you to write custom network drivers if needed.

### Creating and Managing Docker Networks

Here are some useful Docker commands to create, inspect, and remove networks.

#### 1. **Creating a Custom Network**

To create a custom network with a specific driver (e.g., `bridge`):

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
```

To create a network with specific subnets:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 my_custom_network
```

#### 2. **Listing Networks**

To list all networks available on your Docker host:

```bash
docker network ls
```

#### 3. **Inspecting a Network**

To view detailed information about a network:

```bash
docker network inspect my_custom_network
```

#### 4. **Connecting a Container to a Network**

To connect a running container to an existing network:

```bash
docker network connect my_custom_network my_container
```

#### 5. **Disconnecting a Container from a Network**

To disconnect a container from a network:

```bash
docker network disconnect my_custom_network my_container
```

#### 6. **Removing a Network**

To remove a network (make sure no containers are connected to it):

```bash
docker network rm my_custom_network
```

### DNS and Service Discovery in Docker Networks

When containers are connected to a custom network, Docker provides automatic **DNS resolution**. Containers can communicate with each other using their container names instead of IP addresses.

For example:
1. If you run two containers (`container1` and `container2`) on the same network, you can use `container1` as the hostname to connect to `container1` from `container2`.
   
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network nginx
   docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network nginx
   ```

2. From `container2`, you can ping `container1`:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it container2 ping container1
   ```

### Docker Compose and Networking

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Docker Compose automatically creates a network for your application, and containers within the same application can communicate with each other using their service names.

**Example `docker-compose.yml`**:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    networks:
      - my_network
  app:
    image: myapp
    networks:
      - my_network

networks:
  my_network:
    driver: bridge
```

In this example:
- The `web` and `app` services are connected to the same custom network (`my_network`).
- Containers can communicate with each other using the service names (`web` and `app`).

---

### Conclusion

Docker networking provides flexibility and control over how containers communicate with each other and with external systems. The main types of networks—**bridge**, **host**, **overlay**, and **none**—allow you to choose the most appropriate configuration for your use case. Custom networks provide additional features like DNS service discovery and better isolation for multi-container applications. Understanding Docker's networking model is essential for building scalable and secure containerized applications.
