# Docker Images

A **Docker image** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains all the code, libraries, dependencies, and settings required to run a piece of software. It is the blueprint from which Docker containers are created. Docker images are read-only templates, and when you run a container, the Docker engine creates a writable layer on top of the image.

Images are built from **Dockerfiles**, which define the instructions for how to create the image. Docker images are stored in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub), which makes it easy to share and distribute images.

### Key Characteristics of Docker Images

1. **Read-Only**: Docker images are immutable and read-only. When you run a container from an image, the container itself is writable.
2. **Layered Architecture**: Images are made up of multiple layers. Each instruction in a Dockerfile (e.g., `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a new image layer. Layers are cached, which helps speed up the build process.
3. **Portable**: Docker images encapsulate everything an application needs to run, making it easy to deploy the same image across different environments without compatibility issues.
4. **Versioned**: Images can have tags (e.g., `myapp:1.0` or `nginx:latest`) to track different versions of an image.

### Docker Image Structure

A Docker image consists of multiple layers. These layers represent different stages in the build process:

1. **Base Layer**: This is the foundational layer of the image, typically a minimal operating system (e.g., `alpine`, `ubuntu`).
2. **Application Layer**: This layer contains the application and all of its dependencies, such as libraries and configuration files.
3. **Metadata Layer**: Contains metadata about the image, such as the environment variables and configuration instructions.

Each layer is built on top of the previous one. Docker uses a layered filesystem called **UnionFS** to manage these layers efficiently.

### Creating Docker Images

#### 1. **Dockerfile**

A **Dockerfile** is a script that contains a series of instructions for building a Docker image. Each instruction adds a layer to the image.

Example `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json /app/
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . /app/

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Instructions in Dockerfile:
- **FROM**: Specifies the base image (e.g., `node:14`).
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- **COPY**: Copies files or directories from the host system into the image.
- **RUN**: Executes commands (e.g., installing dependencies).
- **EXPOSE**: Exposes a port that the container will listen on.
- **CMD**: Defines the default command to run when the container starts.

#### 2. **Building a Docker Image**

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, use the `docker build` command:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

- `-t myapp:1.0`: This option tags the image as `myapp` with the version `1.0`.
- `.`: The period (`.`) refers to the current directory, which contains the `Dockerfile`.

This will execute the instructions in the `Dockerfile` and create a new image.

### Working with Docker Images

#### 1. **Listing Docker Images**

You can view the list of images available locally on your system with the following command:

```bash
docker images
```

This will display a table of images, showing the image name, tag, image ID, creation date, and size.

#### 2. **Pulling Docker Images**

To download an image from a registry (like Docker Hub), use the `docker pull` command:

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

This will pull the latest version of the `nginx` image from Docker Hub.

You can also pull a specific version (tag) of an image:

```bash
docker pull node:14
```

#### 3. **Tagging Docker Images**

You can tag a Docker image to create different versions of the same image. Use the `docker tag` command:

```bash
docker tag myapp:1.0 myapp:latest
```

This command tags the `myapp:1.0` image with the `latest` tag, allowing you to refer to it by multiple tags.

#### 4. **Pushing Docker Images to a Registry**

To upload your image to a registry (like Docker Hub), you need to log in to your Docker account and use the `docker push` command:

```bash
docker login
docker push myapp:1.0
```

This will upload the `myapp:1.0` image to Docker Hub, making it accessible from anywhere.

#### 5. **Removing Docker Images**

You can delete a Docker image using the `docker rmi` command:

```bash
docker rmi myapp:1.0
```

This will remove the image `myapp:1.0` from your local machine. You may need to stop any running containers based on the image before deleting it.

### Docker Image Registries

1. **Docker Hub**: The default public registry for Docker images. You can find official images, such as those for databases, web servers, and programming languages.
2. **Private Registries**: You can set up your own private registry to store and distribute images securely within your organization. Tools like **Harbor** and **Amazon ECR** provide private registry solutions.

---

### Docker Image Layers and Caching

Docker uses a layered architecture for images. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new image layer. Docker uses a **cache** for layers to optimize image builds:

- **Layer Caching**: If a layer has not changed (e.g., the base image or a set of dependencies), Docker will reuse the cached version of that layer instead of rebuilding it.
- **Cache Busting**: If you want to force Docker to rebuild a layer (e.g., when installing dependencies), you can modify the Dockerfile to invalidate the cache. For example, changing the `COPY` instruction so it triggers a rebuild.

---

### Example: Building a Docker Image for a Web Application

Here’s a simple example of building a Docker image for a Node.js web application:

1. **Create a project directory** and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir myapp
   cd myapp
   ```

2. **Create a `Dockerfile`**:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:14

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY package.json /app/
   RUN npm install

   COPY . /app/

   EXPOSE 3000

   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

3. **Create an application**: Add a simple `package.json` file and `index.js` file to the directory.

4. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp .
   ```

5. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
   ```

### Conclusion

Docker images are essential for creating and distributing containerized applications. By understanding how Docker images are built, tagged, stored, and used, you can easily manage your application’s dependencies and environment. With Docker's layering system, caching, and integration with registries, building and sharing images has never been easier.
